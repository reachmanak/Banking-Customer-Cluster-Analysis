# Clustering--Project

Banking customer segmentations (using clustering methods) to split them into multiple clusters:

- based on demographics
- based on their banking behavior like:
        do they have savings account? How much do they save?
        do they have credit account? How much do they live in debt?
        are they making lot of small transactions or few huge ones?
